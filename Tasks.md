# 🤖 AI Module – Virtual Office Platform


This document outlines all proposed AI-driven ideas.

---

## 📌 Overview

The AI module enhances the Virtual Office experience with:

- Context-aware platform assistance
- Smart transcription and summarization of meetings
- Intelligent task distribution
- Attendance anomaly detection
- Voice-powered search
- Automated resume matching for HR operations

---

## 🧩 Core AI Features & Modules

### 1. 🧠 AI Chatbot (Platform Assistant)

**Goal:**  
Assist users with navigation, task info, file lookup, and FAQs.

**Key Features:**
- Natural language query support
- Contextual help (e.g., "Where is the HR report?")
- Integration with internal APIs

**Tech Stack:**
- NLP: Rasa / OpenAI GPT / LangChain
- Backend: FastAPI or Flask

---

### 2. 📝 Meeting Transcription & Summarization

**Goal:**  
Convert recorded meetings into actionable and summarized notes.

**Pipeline:**
- Transcription: Whisper / AssemblyAI
- Summarization: T5 / BART / GPT-3.5

**Advanced Options:**
- Speaker diarization
- Timestamped key points

---

### 3. ⚙️ Smart Task Assignment

**Goal:**  
Automate task distribution based on workload, availability, and roles.

**Logic:**
- Workload analysis
- Historical task data
- Role-based suitability

**Tech Stack:**
- ML: Scikit-learn / XGBoost
- Data features: Role, workload score, task urgency, etc.

---

### 4. ⏱️ Smart Attendance & Pattern Detection

**Goal:**  
Detect abnormal work patterns, late check-ins, inactivity trends.

**Approach:**
- Time-series & anomaly detection
- Weekly/monthly trend graphs
- Alerts to HR/team leads

**Tech Stack:**
- Time Series: Prophet / Pandas
- Anomaly Detection: Isolation Forest

---

### 5. 🎙 Voice-Based Document & Entity Search

**Goal:**  
Search documents, people, and files via speech.

**Pipeline:**
- Voice-to-text (Whisper)
- NLP search parser
- Document engine (Elasticsearch / FAISS)

**Sample Queries:**
- "Show me intern progress reports"
- "Find Anjali’s resume from May"

---

### 6. 📄 Resume Matching & HR Intelligence

**Goal:**  
Match candidate resumes to job roles using semantic search.

**Steps:**
- Resume parsing and embedding
- Job description vectorization
- Similarity scoring (cosine similarity)

**Tech Stack:**
- Parsing: spaCy / PyResparser
- Embedding: SBERT / OpenAI Embeddings
- Indexing: FAISS

---

## 🧪 Development Plan

| Phase | Features |
|-------|----------|
| **Phase 1** | AI Chatbot, Meeting Transcription & Summarization |
| **Phase 2** | Smart Task Assignment, Attendance Pattern Detection |
| **Phase 3** | Voice-Based Search, Resume Matching for HR |

---

## 🛠 Integration Strategy

- Each AI feature will be built as a **microservice**.
- Communication via REST API / WebSockets.
- Frontend integration in modules like:
  - Chat
  - HR dashboard
  - Meeting room
  - Task manager
